## Title
**"American Medical Costs Across Regions: A Comparative Study of Healthcare Expenses in North, Central, and South America"**

## Main Question
How do demographic factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and regional differences impact healthcare costs in North America, and how can these findings help improve healthcare access and equity across the Americas?

## Description
The "American Medical Costs Across Regions" project focuses on understanding the variation in healthcare expenses across different regions, with an emphasis on North America, but also potentially extending insights to Central and South America. This project will examine how demographic factors, lifestyle choices, and regional disparities influence the cost of medical care. The goal is to understand the patterns in medical costs within these regions, identify disparities, and propose strategies to improve healthcare access and cost-efficiency.

By analyzing relevant datasets that include variables such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region, this project will explore the key drivers of healthcare costs. The analysis will help uncover potential regional inequalities in healthcare expenses, influenced by both socio-economic and lifestyle factors. The goal is to provide insights that can inform healthcare policy, improve access to medical resources, and reduce disparities in healthcare expenses across the Americas.

## Datasources

### Datasource-1: Medical Costs Dataset by WAQI786
This dataset provides detailed information on medical costs across different individuals in the U.S., factoring in demographic details such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. This dataset is critical in understanding how lifestyle factors (like smoking) and personal health conditions (such as BMI) affect the overall healthcare expenses of individuals. The data is instrumental in analyzing how healthcare costs vary across different demographics and regions within the U.S.
