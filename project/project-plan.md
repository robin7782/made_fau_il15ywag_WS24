Title
“The Americas” (Projects with Relation to North, Central, or South America)

Main Question
How do weather patterns, including rainfall, influence economic and environmental conditions in different regions across the Americas, and how can predictive models improve resource management and cooperation?

Description
This project will explore how weather patterns, particularly rainfall, influence various economic and environmental factors across the Americas (North, Central, and South America). Using data from two key datasets, the USA Rainfall Prediction Dataset (2024-2025) and US Weather Events (2016-2022), we will analyze weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall in order to assess their impact on economic productivity, agriculture, and urban planning in different regions.

The end goal is to develop predictive models that can forecast rainfall more accurately and explore how such predictions can support better decision-making in areas like agriculture, disaster preparedness, and urban development. The project aims to understand how regions across the Americas can leverage weather prediction models for sustainable growth and regional cooperation, particularly in response to challenges like climate change and extreme weather events.

Datascources

Datasource-1: USA Rainfall Prediction Dataset (2024-2025)
This dataset provides daily weather data from 20 major cities in the U.S., with important weather variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover, along with a binary target variable, “Rain Tomorrow,” indicating whether it rained the next day. This dataset will help us understand local weather patterns and their immediate impacts on different U.S. regions. By developing predictive models, we can explore how accurate rainfall forecasts can improve local agricultural and urban planning efforts, with applications for other parts of the Americas.

Datasource-2: US Weather Events (2016-2022)
The US Weather Events (2016-2022) dataset records detailed information on weather events across the United States, including rainfall, temperature, and other key weather indicators. It spans a six-year period, allowing for analysis of long-term trends and patterns in rainfall and weather events. By connecting this data with economic and environmental factors, this dataset will contribute to understanding how weather events like rainfall affect regional economies, especially in sectors like agriculture and infrastructure.
