# Project Plan

## Title  
**"Income and Housing: Can Americans Afford the Dream of Homeownership?"**

## Main Question  
What is the correlation between average income and housing prices in the United States, and how many Americans, based on income levels, can realistically afford to own a home in different regions?

## Description  
This project aims to analyze the relationship between income and housing prices in the U.S., focusing on regional disparities and affordability. By leveraging data on average income by ZIP code and housing prices across cities and states, the study seeks to determine the percentage of Americans who can realistically achieve homeownership based on their income levels.

The analysis will provide insights into how economic conditions vary regionally, affecting housing affordability and equity. It will identify which income groups face the greatest challenges in purchasing a home and offer recommendations to address affordability gaps.

## Work Packages  

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**  
   - Merge income and housing datasets based on ZIP codes or regional identifiers.  
   - Clean data for inconsistencies or missing entries.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize trends in housing prices and average incomes across regions.  
   - Compute metrics such as income-to-housing price ratios for affordability analysis.  

3. **Affordability Analysis**  
   - Define affordability benchmarks (e.g., a house is considered affordable if it costs 3â€“4 times the annual income).  
   - Calculate the percentage of people in each ZIP code/region who can afford homes based on these benchmarks.  

4. **Regional Insights**  
   - Identify regions where housing affordability is lowest and highest.  
   - Compare urban versus rural affordability rates.  

5. **Feasibility Study**  
   - Determine how income levels impact the ability to own a home in various states.  
   - Analyze demographic factors (e.g., age, household size) that might influence homeownership rates.  

6. **Recommendations and Insights**  
   - Propose strategies to improve housing affordability for lower-income groups.  
   - Highlight regions requiring urgent policy interventions to reduce affordability gaps.

## Outcome  
This project will quantify the percentage of Americans who can afford homes based on their income and the regional housing market. The findings will provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders interested in addressing housing equity and affordability.
